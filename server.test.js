/**
 * Routing tests.
 *
 * These exist because of one bug, and the bug is worth stating so nobody
 * removes them later as redundant.
 *
 * Routes were matched against `req.url`, which includes the query string. An
 * anchored pattern therefore stopped matching the moment a caller appended
 * anything, the request fell past every route to the catch-all, and the server
 * answered with the HTML page at status 200. Nothing errored anywhere.
 *
 * The detail page cache-busts its avatar with `?t=<now>` so a freshly uploaded
 * picture shows up immediately -- so **the query string added to make the
 * avatar appear was the exact reason it never appeared**. The card grid, which
 * requests the same avatar with no query string, rendered it correctly. That
 * split is why three people spent an afternoon on image formats.
 *
 * These drive the real server. A unit test on the path helper would have passed
 * against the broken code, because the helper was never the broken part -- the
 * routes around it were.
 *
 * Assertions here check the **content type**, not the status, wherever they
 * can. Routing is the property under test, and `/api/status` runs the real
 * status engine, which shells out to tmux; if that engine fails the endpoint
 * answers 500 *as JSON*, which is still correct routing. Asserting on status
 * would make these fail for reasons that have nothing to do with routing.
 *

// Sandbox the real stores BEFORE requiring the server: both modules read their
// root at module load.
//
// ⚠️ There are THREE real roots behind this server, and these two variables
// cover two of them.
//
//   1. `AGENT_WORKFORCE_DATA`  -> the commitment store. Sandboxed here.
//   2. `AGENT_WORKFORCE_WORKERS` -> the instruction files, `~/work/workers/
//      <agent>/CLAUDE.md`. Sandboxed here. These are the LIVE files that the
//      working agents boot from, so a stray PUT does not corrupt test data, it
//      changes how a real agent behaves the next time it starts. The route
//      tests below deliberately drive PUT with a real agent's name, and before
//      this line the only thing standing between them and those files was the
//      handler's `typeof text !== 'string'` check. One test with a valid string
//      would have rewritten a colleague's instructions.
//
//      ⚠️ This variable only covered the instruction read and write when it was
//      first added. `status.js` had its own hardcoded copy of the same path for
//      `readIdentity`, so `snapshot()` kept reading the real files while this
//      comment said they were sandboxed. Reads only, nothing was corrupted, but
//      the comment was the thing a future author would trust before deciding a
//      write was safe. Both modules now read this one variable.
//   3. `store.ROOT` -> avatars and profiles. NOT sandboxed, no variable for it.
//      That is why no test here sends a PUT or DELETE to an avatar or profile
//      route, and why any test that does must sandbox it first. A reviewer once
//      deleted a real avatar by assuming one variable covered everything.
